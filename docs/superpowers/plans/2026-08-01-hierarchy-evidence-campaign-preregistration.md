## R2 groundwork (2026-08-01, verified against the shipped admin DB)

`admin-global-priority.db` carries **exactly 211 borough rows** (the design doc's number,
confirmed). Extraction: `spr.placetype='borough'` joined through `ancestors` to
locality/localadmin parents. Distribution: London 33, Cardiff 33 (inspect — Welsh communities
mis-typed?), Tokyo 23, Rotterdam 23, Paris 20, Amsterdam 8. NOTE: Amsterdam's boroughs are
compass-named (Noord/Zuid/West/Oost/Nieuw-West/Zuidoost) — the directional-homograph class at
placetype grain; law-1-style care applies when these become pair entries. Berlin rows appear
twice (locality + localadmin parents) — dedupe on (child, parent-surface). Next: emit these as
PIX1 rows into the per-locale indexes (London → pair-index-gb; others gated on their locale's
carrier + tag-aliveness per the placetype-evidence doc).
