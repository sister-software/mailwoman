	 * (population) the secondary key WITHIN a tier.** Springfield-IL-over-MA still works (both exact →
	 * same tier → population decides); ME→Maine now works (only Maine is exact → higher tier →
	 * population never gets to override it). See docs/articles/evals/2026-05-30-resolver-exact-match.md.
	 *
	 * Note: tiering re-ranks within the over-fetched candidate window (`limit * 4`); a pathological
