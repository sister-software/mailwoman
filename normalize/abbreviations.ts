 *   suffixes + directional prefixes. fr-FR + others added as needed.
 *
 *   This is the INVERSE of the corpus synthesis pass (which produces `Ave` from `Avenue` for
 *   augmentation). Both sides should eventually share dictionaries; for v1 this dict is duplicated
 *   intentionally — refactoring sharing is a separate task.
