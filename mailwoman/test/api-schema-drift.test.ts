 *
 *   Compile-time drift pin between `@mailwoman/api`'s `GeocodeOutcomeSchema` (hand-modeled from
 *   `GeocodeResult`'s wire shape, with NO import from `mailwoman` — `api/schema.ts`'s engine-agnosticism
 *   boundary) and the real `GeocodeResult` interface this package owns (`geocode-core.ts`). `mailwoman`
 *   is the one workspace allowed to import both sides, so the pin lives here.
 *
 *   THE ALARM IS A TYPE ERROR, NOT A RUNTIME ONE. vitest's esbuild transform strips types without
 *   checking them, so a plain `.test.ts` file gets zero protection from `yarn vitest run` alone — the
 *   type-level declarations below only mean anything under `tsc`. `mailwoman/tsconfig.json` normally
 *   excludes all of `./test/**` (vitest-only, not part of `tsc -b`); this ONE file is carved back in via
 *   an explicit `files` entry specifically so `yarn compile` type-checks it. The `test()` at the bottom
 *   is a secondary, genuinely-useful RUNTIME backstop (see its own comment) — not the primary alarm.
 *
 *   BIDIRECTIONAL, WITH A DOCUMENTED COMPROMISE (per the task brief: "if exact bidirectional
 *   assignability is impossible ... document the achievable direction(s) precisely"):
 *
 *   `GeocodeOutcomeSchema` is deliberately `.loose()` (forward-compat — an engine field the schema
 *   doesn't know about yet still rides through instead of being stripped). `.loose()` gives
 *   `z.infer<typeof GeocodeOutcomeSchema>` an implicit `{ [x: string]: unknown }` catchall, and
 *   TypeScript never treats a plain interface (`GeocodeResult`, no index signature) as assignable TO a
 *   type that has one — regardless of whether the named fields actually line up. Verified empirically
 *   (scratch `tsc` runs, not checked in): `type _x = IsAssignable<GeocodeResult, z.infer<typeof
 *   GeocodeOutcomeSchema>>` is `false` even when every field matches, purely because of the index
 *   signature — "Index signature for type 'string' is missing in type 'GeocodeResult'." So the LITERAL
 *   two-line form the brief sketches (`z.infer<typeof GeocodeOutcomeSchema> = {} as GeocodeResult` and
 *   back) is impossible for a `.loose()` schema in one of the two directions. Below is the closest
 *   equivalent that still catches every real class of drift:
 *
 *   - **Direction 2 — schema-too-wide (overpromises to generated clients), literal form:**
 *     `IsAssignable<Inferred, GeocodeResult>`. If the schema claims a field, or a wider/looser type for
 *     a field, than `GeocodeResult` actually guarantees, this fails to compile — a generated client would
 *     otherwise trust a promise the real engine can violate. Also incidentally catches a field the schema
 *     DROPPED (a dropped field vanishes from `Inferred` too, so assigning into `GeocodeResult` — which
 *     still requires it — fails the same way).
 *   - **Direction 1 — schema-too-narrow (would reject/misdescribe real results), narrowed to declared
 *     fields:** the index signature blocks the literal form, so this checks against `KnownFieldsSchema`
 *     — the SAME shape (`GeocodeOutcomeSchema.shape`, read live off the real export, never hand-copied)
 *     rebuilt WITHOUT `.loose()`'s catchall (`z.object(shape)` defaults to strip mode). That recovers
 *     real per-field type checking (a field typed narrower or outright wrong vs. `GeocodeResult` fails to
 *     compile) but, on its own, cannot see a field entirely ABSENT from the schema — an object missing an
 *     extra property is still structurally assignable to a target that doesn't require it. `_KeysMatch`
 *     closes that specific gap: an exact compile-time key-SET equality between `keyof GeocodeResult` and
 *     the schema's declared keys, so an added/removed/renamed field fails to compile even though the
 *     per-field value check alone would miss it.
 *
 *   Empirically verified each check fires independently: dropping a schema field breaks `_KeysMatch` AND
 *   Direction 2; narrowing one field's type (e.g. `lat` non-nullable) breaks Direction 1 only; adding a
 *   schema field `GeocodeResult` doesn't have breaks `_KeysMatch` alone when the field is optional, and
 *   `_KeysMatch` AND Direction 1 when it's required (Direction 2 permits width subtyping, so an extra
 *   schema-side field can never break it).
 *
 *   `vitest`'s own `expectTypeOf`/`assertType` were deliberately NOT used — they only gain teeth under
 *   `vitest --typecheck` (a mode this repo doesn't run; its default `typecheck.include` is `*.test-d.ts`
 *   anyway, not this file's required `.test.ts` name), so they'd silently no-op under the repo's actual
 *   `yarn vitest run`. The hand-rolled `Equal`/`IsAssignable` utilities below are pure type-level
 *   conditional types with zero runtime footprint and zero new dependencies, wired to fire under the
 *   thing this repo actually runs: `yarn compile`.
