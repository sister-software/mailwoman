 *
 *   UK postcodes: the branded type, the validation shape, normalization, and the outward/inward
 *   split.
 *
 *   This is the MOST COMPLEX postcode of any system in the codex, and the contrast is the whole point
 *   of the file. A US ZIP, a German PLZ, and a French code postal are all a fixed five digits — the
 *   shape is trivial and the only interesting question is what admin unit the prefix maps to. The
 *   UK postcode is none of that:
 *
 *   - It is **variable-length alphanumeric**, from six characters (`M1 1AE`) to eight (`SW1A 1AA`),
 *       across forms like `B33 8TH`, `CR2 6XH`, `DN55 1PT`.
 *   - It splits into an **OUTWARD code** (area + district, the part before the space — `SW1A`) and an
 *       **INWARD code** (sector + unit, the three chars after — `1AA`). Royal Mail sorts on the
 *       outward to a delivery office, then on the inward to a walk.
 *   - And — the lesson that propagates to `postcode-area.ts` — it does **NOT align with administrative
 *       geography**. A postcode area is a Royal Mail routing construct named after a sorting town
 *       (`SW` = south-west London, `EH` = Edinburgh), NOT a county or a constituent country. You
 *       cannot read a county off a UK postcode the way you read a département off a French one; the
 *       postcode→country mapping in `postcode-area.ts` exists precisely _because_ there is no clean
 *       hierarchy to inherit.
 *
 *   So unlike the other systems, the hard work here is the shape itself — validating, normalizing the
 *   internal space, and cleaving outward from inward — not a prefix→admin lookup.
