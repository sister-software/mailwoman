 *
 *   Placetype-pair emission bias — the sixth emission prior (placetype-pair-prior arc, Task 4). The
 *   retrieval-augmented complement to the encoder's own judgment: probes contiguous word windows of
 *   the input against a PIX1 pair index (`pair-index-resolver.ts`) of (child, parent) place-name
 *   pairs harvested from a real address register (Task 3's GB shard: PPD `CITY`/`DISTRICT`), and
 *   nudges the matching BIO label when a window resolves.
 *
 *   Same additive-matrix contract as every other prior in this file (`fst-prior.ts`,
 *   `street-morphology-prior.ts`, `query-shape-prior.ts`'s `addEmissionMatrix`) — a `[seqLen][numLabels]`
 *   matrix the caller folds into the decoder's emissions before Viterbi. The encoder + the other
 *   priors still get the final vote; this one only proposes.
 *
 *   Evidence: rung-3 gate (2026-07-22) measured 100% recall / 0.0% false-positive rate at δ=6.0 on the
 *   probe set that motivated this prior. **Superseded by Task 7's δ calibration** (2026-07-22,
 *   `.superpowers/sdd/task-7-report.md`, a held-out register-row + venue-confound sweep) — the real
 *   `pair-index-gb.bin` artifact now ships δ=5.0 in its header (feed-8k's calibrated optimum and Task
 *   7's recommended ship checkpoint; feed-2k calibrates to 4.5 but fails the FR-fragment
 *   bare-locality bar).
 *
 *   **Disable semantics (final-review fix — the previous wording here was self-contradictory).** This
 *   module has no notion of "on"/"off" by itself — `buildPlacetypePairPriors(opts, …)` just returns a
 *   zero matrix whenever `opts?.index` is absent, and the CALLER (`neural/classifier.ts`'s `#decode`)
 *   decides what `opts` resolves to. Three distinct cases, don't conflate them:
 *
 *   - **No config default, no per-call override** (e.g. `loadFromWeights({ locale: "en-us" })`, which
 *     ships no `pair-index-*.bin` sibling to auto-wire) — genuinely byte-identical to every parse before
 *     this arc: `opts` is `undefined` all the way down.
 *   - **A config default IS auto-wired** (`loadFromWeights` for an en-gb-shaped cache, Task 5) and the
 *     caller passes nothing per-call — the prior is ON, not off; omitting the per-call field does NOT
 *     recover byte-identical behavior in this case (see `ParseOpts.placetypePair`'s own doc comment for
 *     the exact resolution order).
 *   - **A config default is auto-wired and the caller wants it off for THIS call** — pass an explicit
 *     `placetypePair: false` per-call (typed disable, same shape as `spanProposer`). There is no
 *     config-level "null-index override" mechanism; the typed `false` on `ParseOpts` is the real
 *     mechanism.
 *
 *   **Probe mode — the 2026-07-22 venue-confound falsifier verdict, extended by the 2026-07-24 anchored
 *   adjacent-pair design** (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-24-pair-prior-comma-scope-BRAINSTORM_RESPONSE.md`).
 *   `opts.probeMode` selects HOW a candidate is built, and it matters a great deal:
 *
 *   - `"auto"` (**DEFAULT**, v1.1) — the production probe CHAIN: the segment path first (engages iff the
 *     input splits into ≥2 comma-delimited segments, and then runs byte-identically to explicit
 *     `"segment"` mode — a construction property, the chain shares the segment path's code verbatim);
 *     when it cannot engage (a comma-free input is one giant segment — the population segment mode is
 *     deterministically inert on), the anchored-adjacent path takes over. Any anchored bias is strictly
 *     additive against what was previously a guaranteed zero matrix, so byte-stability outside the
 *     comma-free target population is trivial.
 *   - `"segment"` (the v1 default, still available as an explicit override) — a candidate is a WHOLE
 *     comma-delimited segment of the input, folded as one unit. See "Segment mode" below for the full
 *     contract. Comma-free input = one segment = zero matrix, the documented v1 trade-off.
 *   - `"anchored"` — the anchored adjacent-pair path alone (harness use; the chain reaches it only on
 *     comma-free input). See "Anchored mode" below.
 *   - `"window"` — the original sliding 1..{@link WINDOW_MAX_WORDS}-word behavior (see "Window mode"
 *     below), preserved unchanged for opt-in use.
 *
 *   The rung-3 gate above measured the prior's RECALL/FP on a curated probe set — real (child, parent)
 *   pairs in isolation, no surrounding venue text. Task 6 of this arc (`.superpowers/sdd/task-6-report.md`,
 *   2026-07-22) went looking for the failure mode a curated probe set can't see: a **6,500-row venue-confound
 *   board**, built from real UK Food Standards Agency establishment names that happen to embed a real GB
 *   place name inside a longer venue/business string ("Bitterne Charcoal Grill" embeds the place "Bitterne";
 *   "North Cadbury Village Stores Ltd" embeds "North Cadbury"). Run through the full pipeline with the prior
 *   ON in **window mode**, at the real artifact's δ=6.0, against the feed-2k dependent_locality-resurrected
 *   checkpoint: **52.123% false-positive rate** (3,388/6,500 rows emitted a `dependent_locality` span
 *   overlapping the venue's own text) — against a pre-registered FP=0 bar. Window mode's sub-segment
 *   sliding probe has no venue-boundary awareness: it finds "North Cadbury" as a 2-word window INSIDE
 *   "North Cadbury Village Stores Ltd" just as readily as it finds a bare "North Cadbury" standing alone,
 *   because a window is any contiguous 1..3-word run regardless of what larger phrase currently contains
 *   it. Marker suppression ({@link STRUCTURAL_MARKER_WORDS}) closes a handful of specific successor-word
 *   classes ("Church Road", "Manor House") but was never a general venue-boundary detector, and the
 *   venue-confound board's FP hits are dominated by venue name shapes the marker table was never built to
 *   catch ("… Stores Ltd", "… Academy", "… Charcoal Grill"). This is the arc's pre-registered fallback
 *   engaging: **segment mode is the v1 default**, and window mode moves behind this opt-in flag.
 *   Re-enabling window mode as a default requires BOTH (a) a venue-aware suppression mechanism (a
 *   venue/POI-name detector ahead of the prior, not just a fixed successor-word table) AND (b) a
 *   re-measured venue-confound FP of 0 on this same board (or its successor) with that mechanism engaged —
 *   see the task-6 report's "Concerns for whoever adjudicates the acceptance bars" §1 for the design options
 *   considered and not yet built.
 *
 *   **Segment mode.** A candidate is an ENTIRE comma-delimited segment of the input — not a sliding
 *   sub-window. Segments are reconstructed from the tokenizer pieces' own character offsets against the raw
 *   input text (`opts.inputText`, mirroring `query-shape-prior.ts`'s `BuildPriorsOpts.inputText` — the caller
 *   supplies the same raw text it already has in hand; see {@link buildSegmentWindows}): every literal `,`
 *   character in the input increments the segment counter, and each non-punctuation word group is assigned
 *   to the segment its first piece's start offset falls into. A segment's key is the WHOLE segment folded —
 *   both the space-joined form (each word's own fold, joined with `" "`) and the concat form (joined with no
 *   separator) — exactly the same dual-key contract as window mode's "dual-key probe" section below, just at
 *   segment granularity instead of per-window. This is what defeats the venue-confound class structurally:
 *   "North Cadbury Village Stores Ltd" is ONE segment (no internal comma), so its only candidate key is the
 *   5-word fold "north cadbury village stores ltd" — which never equals the census's 2-word "north cadbury"
 *   entry. A real place name only fires when it occupies a segment BY ITSELF (i.e. the input actually
 *   comma-delimits it as its own field) — which is exactly the shape a real structured address has
 *   ("5 Fishburn Road, Fishburn, Stockton-on-Tees") and a venue-embedding string does not.
 *
 *   **Same-field trailing postcode (#1308).** An idiomatic NZ / free-text GB address writes the postcode in the SAME
 *   comma-field as the post town, with no comma between them: "…Plimmerton, Porirua 5026", "…Henbury, Macclesfield SK11
 *   9PD". Without correction that segment folds to "porirua 5026" / "macclesfield sk11 9pd" and misses the index's bare
 *   "porirua" / "macclesfield" parent, so the (child, parent) pair never fires (the comma-separated "…, Porirua, 5026"
 *   and no-postcode forms already flip — the postcode simply lands in its own segment there). The segment path fixes this
 *   by stripping a TRAILING postcode-shaped run from a segment's KEY before it becomes a parent-candidate probe key — per
 *   the index header country's postcode shape (`@mailwoman/codex/<system>`; see {@link segmentParentPostcodeShape} /
 *   {@link stripTrailingSegmentPostcode}). Only a trailing run, never a segment that IS just a postcode, and only for a
 *   country with a known codex shape (else byte-stable). SEGMENT PATH ONLY — anchored mode already anchors LEFT of the
 *   whole postcode span (see "Anchored mode"), and window mode is untouched. Positions/pieceIndices still span the whole
 *   segment, so only the probe key changes.
 *
 *   **Identity pairs — the repeated-name convention (segment path only).** Some registers conventionally
 *   write the same name twice when the dependent locality and the post town coincide — NZ is the measured
 *   case ("Mangawhai, Mangawhai": 63/246 rows of the NZ golden board, 25.6%; task-8 report § "NZ arc"),
 *   and the LINZ-built pair index records the identity pair ("mangawhai","mangawhai") accordingly. The
 *   (x,x) entry IS the evidence of the convention (registry-evidence semantics): it says "when this name
 *   appears twice in adjacent fields, the FIRST occurrence is the dependent locality and the second is the
 *   post town." Without special handling, BOTH identical adjacent segments loop through the X role, each
 *   probes the other successfully, both receive the bias, and the parse fuses/mis-tags what should be
 *   dependent_locality("Mangawhai") + locality("Mangawhai"). The rule: when a segment's IMMEDIATELY
 *   PRECEDING segment folds to an identical key (any fold form — space-join or concat, so a cross-spelling
 *   repeat like "Stockton-on-Tees, Stockton on Tees" also counts; see {@link sharesFoldForm}), that segment
 *   is a REPEAT and draws no bias from any identical-key partner — the model's own (typically strong
 *   locality) read stands. The head of the run keeps today's behavior and takes the identity bias. In a run
 *   of ≥3 identical adjacent segments ("X, X, X"), only the FIRST overall is biased: every non-head member
 *   is a repeat and skips identical-key partners in BOTH directions (its following twin included) — biasing
 *   the first member of each overlapping pair (first AND second) would recreate exactly the
 *   two-adjacent-biased-segments fusion this rule removes. NON-adjacent identical segments ("Mangawhai,
 *   Something, Mangawhai") are outside the convention's shape and keep the ordinary two-sided behavior
 *   unchanged. Non-identical pairs are untouched in every respect, and inputs with no identical adjacent
 *   segment keys are byte-stable (asserted in the test suite). Country-agnostic by design: the semantics
 *   engage wherever a register records the convention — measured 2026-07-24, the shipped `pair-index-gb.bin`
 *   (19,209 entries, built 2026-07-23) contains ZERO identity pairs, so GB is unaffected today, but a future
 *   GB build that records CITY==DISTRICT rows would get the same treatment for free. Window mode is
 *   deliberately excluded (its overlapping sub-windows make "adjacent identical candidates" a different,
 *   unmeasured population); the anchored path needs no equivalent rule — it only ever biases the child left
 *   of the parent anchor, so a comma-free "Mangawhai Mangawhai" already biases the first occurrence only.
 *
 *   Two known, honestly-reported trade-offs of the segment default (Task 6 measurements, all against the
 *   feed-2k checkpoint): (1) a residual FP class survives — when a non-venue FIELD (e.g. the venue-confound
 *   board's synthetic `street` field) happens to equal a bare census child verbatim as its OWN segment (e.g.
 *   `"Moelfre B & B, Moelfre, Abergele, …"` — the street segment is literally "Moelfre"), segment mode still
 *   fires, because the mechanism is purely textual/segmental, not semantic; this is not a bug in the segment
 *   restriction, it is the segment restriction doing exactly what it's specified to do. (2) recall on a
 *   comma-FREE input degrades toward inert, because a comma-free string is one giant segment with no
 *   internal split — see the task-6 report's Measurement 2(c) for the exact number. Window mode remains
 *   available, opt-in, for callers who have their own venue-boundary gate and have re-verified FP=0.
 *
 *   **Anchored mode (v1.1)** — the comma-free complement to segment mode, reached by the `"auto"` chain
 *   exactly where segment mode is structurally inert. The delta vs window mode is candidate SELECTION
 *   only (the probing/dual-key/bias machinery is shared verbatim): instead of probing every window
 *   against every other window anywhere in the string (the any-to-any geometry behind window mode's
 *   79% venue-confound FP at δ=10 — see the brainstorm doc's FP anatomy), candidates are pinned to the
 *   register-style GB suffix geometry: the PARENT (post-town position) is a 1..{@link WINDOW_MAX_WORDS}-word
 *   window immediately LEFT of a postcode-shaped span (shape per `postcode-repair.ts`'s
 *   {@link collectMatches} — the same family the repair pass and postcode-anchor path run; the anchor
 *   sits left of the WHOLE span, GB outward+inward included), or the string-FINAL window when no
 *   postcode shape is present. The CHILD is a 1..{@link ANCHORED_CHILD_MAX_WORDS}-word window
 *   immediately left of the parent (`child.endPos + 1 === parent.startPos`). Candidates are tried
 *   longest-match-first on both sides, which implements LEFT-MAXIMALITY for free: if extending the
 *   child one word left also pairs with the same parent, the longer child was already probed (and won)
 *   before the shorter one — a partial-child probe ("cadbury" under "north cadbury") can never fire.
 *   The FIRST hit biases the CHILD span only (the parent keeps the model's own — typically strong
 *   `locality` — read, matching how the other modes only ever bias the X role) and probing stops.
 *   Marker suppression applies to the child exactly as window mode applies it. A venue-embedded
 *   confound at the string start ("Queens Park Cafe …") is rejected by construction — its text is
 *   never immediately left of the post-town anchor.
 *
 *   **Windowing (window mode only).** A candidate is any CONTIGUOUS run of 1..{@link WINDOW_MAX_WORDS}
 *   non-punctuation words (punctuation-only word groups, e.g. a bare comma, are skipped without breaking
 *   contiguity — same idiom as `fst-prior.ts`/`street-morphology-prior.ts`). `WINDOW_MAX_WORDS = 3` is the
 *   p99 of the GB PPD `CITY` word-length distribution measured building the Task-3 artifact (n=9,031,691
 *   non-empty-CITY rows):
 *
 *   | words | rows      | share  |
 *   |-------|-----------|--------|
 *   | 1     | 6,614,402 | 73.2%  |
 *   | 2     | 2,043,332 | 22.6%  |
 *   | 3     |   345,064 |  3.8%  |
 *   | 4     |    28,606 |  0.3%  |
 *   | 5     |       287 | <0.01% |
 *
 *   p50=1, p90=2, **p99=3**, max=5. Going to the observed max (5) buys negligible additional recall
 *   against real over-matching risk on short common words — 3 is the frozen scale; widening it is a
 *   future tunable, not a free lunch.
 *
 *   **The folded window key is a SPACE-JOIN of each word's own fold**, not a joint fold of the
 *   concatenated text: `normalizeFSTToken("St")` + `" "` + `normalizeFSTToken("Helens")` → `"st helens"`.
 *   This mirrors exactly how the Task-3 builder folds the source register's multi-word `CITY` values
 *   (`normalizeFSTToken` preserves interior Zs whitespace — see that function's docstring) — a window
 *   probe that instead concatenated the words with no separator (`"sthelens"`) would never hit a real
 *   index entry. See `placetype-pair-prior.test.ts` for the "St Helens" regression case.
 *
 *   **Dual-key probe (hyphen/space cross-form).** The space-join above is right for a source `CITY` value
 *   that was itself written with spaces ("St Helens"). It is WRONG for a source value that was written
 *   hyphenated ("Stockton-on-Tees") — `normalizeFSTToken` strips the hyphens as punctuation, so the Task-3
 *   builder folds that field to ONE concatenated token, `"stocktonontees"`, with no interior space at all.
 *   A query that instead WRITES the same place with spaces ("Stockton on Tees") groups into three
 *   `▁`-delimited words, and its space-joined window key (`"stockton on tees"`) never matches that
 *   concatenated index entry. So every window is probed under BOTH candidate keys — the space-join AND the
 *   bare concatenation (`slice.map(fstToken).join("")`) — for BOTH the X and Y role, since either side of a
 *   real pair can be the multi-word one. `probeWindows` tries the four `(x-form, y-form)` combinations in a
 *   fixed order — space/space, space/concat, concat/space, concat/concat — and returns on the first hit: a
 *   real index cannot disagree with itself on the SAME pair of real-world places, but if a contrived index
 *   ever did resolve two different tags across forms, this order means the space-joined attempt (tried
 *   first) wins. A single-word window's two forms are identical strings, so this costs nothing extra for
 *   the common case — the extra probes only fire for genuine multi-word windows.
 *
 *   **Two-sided, order-free matching.** For each candidate window X (in either textual position
 *   relative to any other window — "two-sided" means the search for a matching partner is NOT limited
 *   to windows that follow X, unlike the forward-only FST walk in `fst-prior.ts`), X gets a bias iff
 *   some OTHER, DISJOINT window Y (word-group ranges must not overlap) anywhere in the input satisfies
 *   `index.probe(x.key, y.key) === tag`. Looping every window through the X role (not just probing one
 *   direction from a fixed anchor) is what makes the pair discoverable regardless of which of the two
 *   real-world roles (child/parent) happens to come first in the query text — a real (child, parent)
 *   pair is found once per member, independently, when that member takes the X role in its own
 *   iteration. Distance/adjacency between X and Y is NOT weighted — a future tunable, frozen at "off"
 *   for this task per the same "note as a future tunable" discipline as `fst-prior.ts`'s length-scaling
 *   header.
 *
 *   **Marker suppression** (the DeepSeek venue-confound filter) — **active in both probe modes,
 *   unchanged by the segment-mode default**. A candidate immediately followed by a structural-marker word
 *   (or a house-number-shaped token) is a street/venue HEAD, not a standalone place reference, and is
 *   skipped outright — no probe, no bias — regardless of whether it would otherwise have matched.
 *   Rationale per marker, see {@link STRUCTURAL_MARKER_WORDS}: without this, a pair-index entry like
 *   `("church", "some-locality")` would fire on "Church" in "Church House" / "Church Road" / "Church
 *   Court" — none of which are the place "Church", all of which are street/venue names that happen to
 *   START with a word the register also knows as a place name somewhere else in the country. This is a
 *   narrower, purely lexical defense than the venue-confound falsifier above needed — it was never meant
 *   to be a general venue-boundary detector, which is exactly why the segment restriction exists
 *   alongside it rather than instead of it.
 *
 *   **Segment-boundary awareness (final-review fix).** In segment mode, the successor check only suppresses when the
 *   successor word is in the SAME comma-delimited segment as the candidate — a successor that has already crossed into
 *   the NEXT segment can never be read as a street/venue-head suffix of THIS candidate, because a comma sits between
 *   them. Reviewer repro: `"Fishburn, 5 Fishburn Road"` — "Fishburn" (segment 0) must NOT be suppressed by "5"
 *   (segment 1's first word, a house-number shape), because the comma means "5" is never a suffix of "Fishburn" in the
 *   source text. Since a segment-mode candidate already spans its ENTIRE segment (see "Segment mode" below), this
 *   check is structurally near-inert for segment mode's own candidates — the real protection against a "Church
 *   Road"-shaped false read is the whole-segment fusion itself ("Church Road" is one candidate, key "church road",
 *   never probed as bare "church"); the successor check here exists for defense-in-depth and to keep window mode's
 *   (comma-oblivious, unchanged) behavior sharing one code path. See `isMarkerSuppressed`'s doc comment for the exact
 *   mechanism.
 *
 *   **Bias write.** `+delta` on `B-<tag>` (window's first piece) / `I-<tag>` (the rest), same
 *   per-piece pattern as `fst-prior.ts`'s `applyBias` — `Math.max` against any bias already written by
 *   an earlier window, never additive-stacked. `delta` resolves as `index.delta ?? opts.biasScale ??`
 *   {@link DEFAULT_DELTA} — the real artifact's header carries the calibrated per-country `delta` (5.0 for GB as of the 2026-07-22 calibration; see task-7 sweep), so `biasScale` exists
 *   only as an override for a hand-built `PairIndexLike` test double that omits it.
 *
 *   **Transition term (TRANSITION-BETA build, 2026-07-24).** When the index header carries the optional
 *   `transitionBeta` (see `PairIndexHeader.transitionBeta`), every applied bias ALSO emits a
 *   position-scoped decoder transition adjustment — `+β` on every transition into `B-<tag>` at the child
 *   span's first piece (see {@link TransitionAdjustment} and `viterbi.ts`'s `ViterbiTransitionAdjustment`).
 *   This is the path-fusion recovery lever the task-8 transition-level probe measured: the emission δ can
 *   win the per-token argmax at the child-start piece while the global Viterbi still routes through a
 *   fused street/locality run; the entry-transition bonus pays the structural continuation toll directly
 *   (β=5: 13/17 comma-free GB misses recovered, zero measured collateral). No hit / no `transitionBeta` →
 *   an empty adjustment list, byte-identical decode to the emission-only behavior. One refinement
 *   (2026-07-24, the v2 battery's single named-row regression): a child immediately preceded by a
 *   venue-title preposition ("New Inn at Hoff") keeps the emission bias but draws NO transition
 *   adjustment — see {@link TITLE_PREPOSITION_PREDECESSORS} for the rationale and growth discipline.
 *
 *   Missing index (`opts` undefined, or `opts.index` absent) → zero matrix, composes harmlessly with
 *   `addEmissionMatrix`. Same for a present-but-empty/never-matching index (no country data loaded for
 *   this locale) — the probe loop simply never finds a tag.
